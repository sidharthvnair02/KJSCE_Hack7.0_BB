Problem Statement: The current state of the tourist places and hotel booking industry lacks a comprehensive and efficient platform that integrates the booking of tourist places, accommodations, and tourist guides in a seamless manner. The existing booking systems are often fragmented, with users having to use multiple apps or websites to book different components of their trip. This leads to a poor user experience, and makes it difficult for travelers to plan and book their trips efficiently. Our aim is to create a platform that streamlines the booking process by integrating all the components of a trip into one app, providing a seamless and efficient booking experience for users.
